1.Strategy Design

The Strategy pattern defines famliy of algorithms encapsulates each one and make them interchangable. Strategy let's 
algorithm vary independently from client that use it.

Composition - Has a relationship
Inheritance - Is a relationship

Problem in inheritance is that it's not possible to share inhertance behaviour horizontally.
So the solution is that extract the algorithm [Behaviour] and make them use freely on the basis of Object calling it.
